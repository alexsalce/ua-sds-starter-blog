# Now that you're up and running...

Welcome to your blog site! 

If you're just starting, it probably looks fairly tacky. Thankfully it doesn't take too much effort to start making it your own.

This post will outline the elements of your site development and maintenance that you will care most about, how to do some customization, and generally what you will most often be tweaking to maintain.

If you have just gotten everything up and running, your VSCode environment should look something like this:

<div className="-mx-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
![new project](/static/images/tutorial/newproject.png)
</div>


## How do I customize my site?

### Site Metadata

The first step in customizing your site is to personalize its metadata. In your Explorer window, navigate to the `data` folder and open `siteMetadata.js`.

<div className="-mx-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
![site metadata](/static/images/tutorial/sitemetadata.png)
</div>

<div className="-mx-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
![site metadata](/static/images/tutorial/site_metadata.png)
</div>

You can comment out any links that you don't want (6).
