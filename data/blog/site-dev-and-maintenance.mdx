# Now that you're up and running...

Welcome to your blog site! 

If you're just starting, it probably looks fairly tacky. Thankfully it doesn't take too much effort to start making it your own.

This post will outline the elements of your site development and maintenance that you will care most about, how to do some customization, and generally what you will most often be tweaking to maintain.

If you have just gotten everything up and running, your VSCode environment should look something like this:

<div className="-mx-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
![new project](/static/images/tutorial/newproject.png)
</div>


## How do I customize my site?

[A quick explainer can be found here at @timlrx Tailwind Blog template README](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog?tab=readme-ov-file#extend--customize)

[Also worth a read](https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog/introducing-tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog)

This post goes into more detailed customization, and some items that are unique to this template.

### Site Metadata

The first step in customizing your site is to personalize its metadata. In your Explorer window, navigate to the `data` folder and open `siteMetadata.js`.

<div className="-mx-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
![site metadata](/static/images/tutorial/sitemetadata.png)
</div>

Update your properties as you would like. Below is reference for the mapping of each property to the site.

<div className="-mx-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
![site metadata](/static/images/tutorial/site_metadata.png)
</div>

You can comment out any links that you don't want (6). 

Use the `stickynav` logical property to set whether you would like your navbar to stick to the top while scrolling.

### Pictures and Icons

There are several files that comprise all of the logos and icons that you will care about for your site.  We will reference this figure below.

<div className="-mx-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
![site logos and avatar](/static/images/tutorial/site_logos_avatar.png)
</div>

(1) To update your `avatar` photo sitewide, which is used primarily for your Author image and for the splash page hero, replace the `avatar.png` file in the `public/static` folder.

(2)  The `favicons` require update if you want something other than the Block A logo. Unfortunately, I don't have a simple set of instructions here to update these without downloading the Adobe tools. Fortunately, if you are a student, you can get them for free here:

[Adobe Creative Cloud](https://adobe.arizona.edu/signup/adobe-creative-cloud)

I have made an Adobe Illustator template, which can be found in the `public/static/favicons/template` directory, called `icons.ai`.  It has premade canvases that can be used to export and overwrite each of the files in the `favicons` folder. Be sure to export the correct file type and the correct corresponding dimensions for each.

(3) `public/static/images/logo.png` is only used in the Hero, but it's also useful to have a logo file that can be used throughout the site. It's also used in the `siteMetadata.js` as a site logo parameter, although I am not clear how it is used in the web app.

(4) In the `data` folder, `logo.svg` should be changed to your logo if you would like something other than the Block A, but it must be an SVG file. The template in `public/static/favicons/template` also has a canvas to export your own logo as an SVG. This logo will be on your navbar, and can be used anywhere else on your side by the same method used in `components/Header.tsx`.

### Colors

#### Site Colors

The site's color schemes are dictated by CSS (namely in `css/tailwind.css`), however the primary hooks for changing colors across the board can be found in the `tailwind.config.js` file in the root directory.  You will primarily want to edit the colors property in the `module_exports` (should be lines `27-30`).

```js
colors: {
        primary: colors.rose,
        gray: colors.slate,
      },
```
`primary` will primarily affect text, links, etc. `gray` will affect dark mode colors including the background.  You can use the color palettes defined by Tailwind CSS to make quick "broad strokes" updates:

[Tailwind Color Palettes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors)

Of course, all of the CSS is customizable, so any fields in `tailwind.config.js` as well as `css/tailwind.css` can be modified to change the overall looks of the site.

#### Code Chunk Colors

The `css/prism.css` CSS file is dedicated to the styling of code chunks. There are great themes available at this repo if you want to try something different than the template:

[PrismJS Prism Themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes)

### Fonts

There are two steps to modifying the default font for the site.

The first step requires opening `app/layout.tsx`. For reference, we can look at how to import the default font `Space_Grotesk`. 

```js
import { Space_Grotesk } from 'next/font/google'
// ...
const space_grotesk = Space_Grotesk({
  subsets: ['latin'],
  display: 'swap',
  variable: '--font-space-grotesk',
})
```
We can choose a font we want from `next/font/google`, see the below documentation.

- [Next.js Optimizing Fonts](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts)

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

Once we create a variable for our chosen font, the default font for the site can be modified using the `fontFamily` property in `tailwind.config.js`.

```js
      fontFamily: {
        sans: ['var(--font-space-grotesk)', ...fontFamily.sans],
      },
```

### Blog Posts, Authors, and CV

#### Blog Posts

All of your blog posts 

Check out the example for how to format a blog post header here:

[@timrlx Post Formatting](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog?tab=readme-ov-file#post)

#### Authors



#### CV

You can customize your CV by modifying the `data/resume/default.mdx` file, using the template as guidance for formatting (it's just pretty simple markdown syntax).


## More Advanced Stuff

### Layouts, Components, and Pages

> [!WARNING]
> This is where it gets a little heavy

If you take a look at the blog template from which this was originally created...

[Tailwind CSS Blog](https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/)

...you'll notice a difference in the layout of the landing page.

Each page is rendered from Typescript files in the `app` folder, namely `app/layout.tsx` which controls the overall layout of the whole site, and in the case of the landing page, `app/Main.tsx`.

If we open `app/Main.tsx` we can see where I manually placed a 'Component', the `SDSHero`.

```js
// ...
// import custom SDSHero (sds_custom)
import SDSHero from '@/components/SDSHero'
// ...
export default function Home({ posts }) {
  return (
    <>
      <SDSHero />
// ...
```

The `SDSHero` Component is a very simple custom component that I created for the site, and I suggest you open it and have a quick look. Next.js is an object-oriented framework, and Components are objects that are importable throughout layouts in the web app that get rendered dynamically using `contentlayer`.

If we, for example, want to remove the `SDSHero` from the landing page, we can just comment out or delete it from `app/Main.tsx`.

When we want to make a **new** page for our site (maybe something different than a blog, or an about me page), it needs to be defined in the `app` folder with a subdirectory that contains a `page.tsx` file, which defines all of the imports, layouts of all the components, just overall what the page should look like. It also needs to be instructed to be rendered with `contentlayer`. We make the structure of the new page we want in our web app in the `app` folder, and then we must modify `contentlayer.config.ts` in the root folder. We may also need some `css` and components to help make it render the way we want.

#### Resume Example

The `app/resume` layout was a custom layout that I added to this site (credit to [Trillium's Blog](https://github.com/trillium/trilliumsmith.com) for the code), and we can run through how it was created.  First, we 

Inside of `contentlayer.config.ts`, we need to 

```ts
//need to add Resume contentlayer configuration, any new react app page needs added here, use others for format (sds_custom)
export const Resume = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: 'Resume',
  filePathPattern: 'resume/**/*.mdx',
  contentType: 'mdx',
  fields: {
    name: { type: 'string', required: true },
    avatar: { type: 'string' },
    occupation: { type: 'string' },
    company: { type: 'string' },
    email: { type: 'string' },
    linkedin: { type: 'string' },
    github: { type: 'string' },
    layout: { type: 'string' },
  },
  computedFields,
}))
```
